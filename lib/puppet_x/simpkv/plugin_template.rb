# SIMPKV PLUGIN REQUIREMENTS
# - The plugin type derived from the plugin's base filename must be unique
#   over **all** plugins loaded.
#   - The simpkv adapter will only load the first plugin it finds of any given
#     type.
#   - The simpkv adapter will emit a warning when multiple plugin files for the
#     same type are detected.
#
# - The plugin code must implement the API in this template.
#
# - The plugin code **must** protect from cross-puppet-environment contamination.
#   Different versions of the module containing this plugin may be loaded
#   into the puppetserver at the same time. So, unlike normal Ruby library
#   code for which only one version will be loaded at a time (e.g., gems
#   installed in the puppetserver), you have to explicitly design this plugin
#   code to prevent cross-environment-contamination.  This is why the plugin
#   architecture requires this class to be anonymous and loads it appropriately.
#   You **must** provide similar protections for any supporting Ruby code that you
#   package in the module (e.g., a separate connector class). If you are not
#   sure how to do this, just keep all of your plugin code within its anonymous
#   class.
#
# - The plugin code must allow multiple instances to be instantiated and run
#   concurrently.
#
# - The plugin code is responsible for executing any appropriate retry logic
#   on failed backend operations.
#
# - The plugin code must protect itself from hung operations.
#
# - When accessing the backend in the put(), get(), ... methods, the plugin code
#   should catch exceptions, convert them to meaningful error messages and then
#   return the failed status in its public API.
#
# - If your plugin uses Ruby Gems that do not come standard with Puppet Ruby,
#   you must list them as requirements in your plugin's documentation and
#   should provide instructions on how to install those Gems.

# Each plugin **MUST** be an anonymous class accessible only through
# a `plugin_class` local variable.
# DO NOT CHANGE THE LINE BELOW!!!!

  # WARNING:
  # In typical Ruby code, using constants and class methods is quite normal.
  # Unfortunately, you cannot use constants or class methods in an anonymous
  # class, as they will be added to the Class Object, itself, and will not be
  # available to the anonymous class. In other words, you will be tearing your
  # hair out trying to figure out why normal Ruby code does not work here!

  ###### Public Plugin API ######

  # Construct an instance of this plugin setting its instance name
  #
  # @param name Name to ascribe to this plugin instance
  #
  def initialize(name)
    # save this off, because the simpkv adapter will access it through a getter
    # (defined below), when constructing log messages
    @name = name

    # You can use the Puppet object for logging
    Puppet.debug("#{@name} simpkv plugin constructed")
  end

  # Configure this plugin instance using global and plugin-specific
  # configuration found in options
  #
  # FIXME:  The description below is informational for you as a developer.
  # Insert the appropriate description of configuration your plugin
  # supports.
  #
  # The simpkv adapter will call this method before any of the public API methods
  # retrieve or change keystore state (i.e., delete(), deletetree(), exists(),
  # that get(), list(), put()).
  #
  # The plugin-specific configuration will be found in
  # `options['backends'][ options['backend'] ]`
  #
  # For example,
  # {
  #   # global options
  #   'environment' => 'production',  # <== environment for the node
  #   'softfail'    => false,         # <== for use by simpkv Puppet functions
  #
  #   # specific backend config to use
  #   'backend' => 'example_1',      # <== tells you which config to use, i.e.,
  #                                  #     the key in 'backends' Hash       ----

  # The remaining methods in this API map one-for-one to those in
  # simpkv's Puppet function API.
  #
  # IMPORTANT API NOTES:
  #
  # - An instance of this plugin class will persist through a single catalog
  #   run.
  # - Other instances of this plugin class may be running concurrently in
  #   the same process.
  #
  #   * Make sure your code is multi-thread safe if you are using any
  #     mechanisms that would cause concurrency problems!
  #
  # - All key values persisted and returned are Strings.  Other software in
  #   the simpkv function chain is responsible for serializing non-String
  #   values into Strings for plugins to persist and then deserializing
  #   Strings retrieved by plugins back into objects.
  #
  # - Each of the API methods return a results object that is a Hash
  #   with 2 keys:
  #
  #   * :result - The result of the operation.  Operation specific.
  #   * :err_msg - A String you set to an error message that is meaningful
  #     to the end user, upon failure.
  #
  # - Although the simpkv adapter will rescue any exceptions thrown, each of
  #   these methods should do its very best to rescue all exceptions itself,
  #   and then convert the exceptions to a failed status result with a
  #   meaningful error message.
  #
  #         >> Only you have the domain knowledge <<
  #         >> to create useful error messages!   <<
  #
  # - If your plugin connects to an external service, you are strongly
  #   encouraged to build timeouts and retry logic into your backend
  #   operations.
  #
  #   * The simpkv adapter does not currently protect against hung operations.
  #   * Only you have domain knowledge to know when a connection is hung
  #     and when a retry of a failed operaton is appropriate.
