# NOTES FOR TEST MAINTAINERS:
# This file specifies test key information in a data structure corresponding to
# the Simpkv_test::KeyInfo type alias. This data or data derived from it will be
# used to stimulate simpkv_test manifests to test simpkv functions.
#
# ** Please take time to understand how the simpkv_test module works! **
#
# Important details about this key information are as follows:
# * The keys are designed to cover a wide variety of keys types a user could
#   specify. This includes:
#   - Keys with simple values (Boolean, Integer, Float, String)
#   - Keys with complex values (Hash, Array)
#   - Keys that have to be handled with special Puppet code (Binary values)
#   - Puppet-environment-specific keys
#   - Global keys
#   - Keys with/without metadata
#   - Keys with/without path elements in their key names
# * The keys are explicitly designed to test that key uniqueness is
#   appropriately handled.
#    - Keys are supposed to be uniquely specified by their
#      {key path, global status, and backend} triples.
#    - This data and the tests **ASSUME** a one-to-one mapping of app_id
#      to backend, and so a key is uniquely specified by its
#      {key path, global status, and app_id} triple.
#    - This file contains multiple keys with the same key path, but different
#      content and different combinations of app_id and global status.
# * The key info is also designed to test different folder configurations
#   - Folders with keys and sub-folders
#   - Folders with only keys
#   - Folders with only sub-folders
#
# Also of note:
# - This file currently only supports 3 different app_ids.
# - Binary data is loaded with the Puppet binary_file() method, so the
#   'file' specification must match what that function requires.
# - Validation logic elsewhere assumes the Binary value of a key will be found
#   in a file in the simpkv_test module.
